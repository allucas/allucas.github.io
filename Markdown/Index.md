# COVID-19 Vaccine and Treatment Development Tracker

Welcome to **covid-vaccine-tracker.com**. This website presents a summary of the data published by the **WHO** regarding the develipment of COVID-19 vaccines (https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1). Data for treatments for COVID-19 under development is derived from the **Milken Institute** vaccine and treatment spreadsheet (https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19-Tracker-3-36-20-FINAL.pdf). No modifications have been made to the data. This has been done as an attempt to make this information more easily accessible to the public. The website is updated on a daily basis.
